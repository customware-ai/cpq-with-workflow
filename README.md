# Template for React Router App with Tailwind CSS and SQLite

**This is a code style and architecture template repository.** Use it as a reference for coding patterns, project structure, and development standards when building production applications.

The template demonstrates a simplified, modern stack with React Router v7, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Hono, tRPC, and SQLite via Drizzle + better-sqlite3. The `app/` shell is the starter surface; the `server/` tree is an example backend slice that can be kept, replaced, or removed when your real API lands.

> **⚠️ Important**: This is a **template repository** showcasing patterns and structure, not a feature-complete product.

> **Required reading**: Review [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) before development for commands, coding standards, and architecture rules.

## 📋 What This Template Provides

### ✅ Use This Template For:

- **Code Style Reference** - TypeScript + React + Tailwind conventions
- **Architecture Patterns** - Clean layering (contracts → queries → services → routes)
- **Type Safety Examples** - Zod contracts + neverthrow error handling
- **UI Component Library** - Reusable, tested UI primitives
- **Database Patterns** - Drizzle schema + migration workflow
- **Project Organization** - Scalable app/server/test directory structure

### ❌ This Template Does NOT Provide:

- A complete business product
- Domain-complete ERP/accounting features
- Ready-to-ship production logic without adaptation

### 💡 How to Use This Template:

1. Study the patterns in `app/`, `server/`, and `tests/`
2. Copy the structure into your own project
3. Replace or delete the sample estimate slice when you wire your real backend
4. Keep strict contracts and Result-based error handling
5. Follow [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for development workflow

## 🔍 What's Working vs What's a Pattern

### ✅ Fully Functional (Study These):

- **UI shell and workflow pages** - Shared `MainLayout` + route-backed CPQ workflow starter
- **Server example slice** - `estimate` contract/query/service/tRPC route chain, kept as reference wiring only
- **Database layer** - Drizzle schema + generated SQL migrations + runner
- **Quality gates** - Typecheck, lint, build, and test workflows
- **Component library** - Tested reusable UI building blocks

### 📐 Pattern Scaffolding:

- **tRPC client/provider files in `app/lib/`** - Available as typed integration scaffolding
- **Example backend note** - The `server/` files are intentionally sample-only until a consuming project swaps in its own API contract
- **Single-module backend design** - Intentionally minimal for extension

## Template Features & Patterns

This template demonstrates:

- **Modern Stack**: React Router SPA mode with Hono + tRPC backend, Vite 8, strict TypeScript
- **Type Safety**: Zod runtime contracts + neverthrow Result/ResultAsync patterns
- **Database Layer**: better-sqlite3 + Drizzle ORM with migration-driven schema changes
- **UI Patterns**: Tailwind CSS v4 with reusable components and a shared app layout
- **Workflow Engine Starter**: CPQ workflow data drives stages, steps, progress, and page routing
- **Code Quality**: Type-aware linting (oxlint) + Vitest coverage
- **Architecture**: Explicit client/server boundary with typed API contracts

## Workflow Starter

This starter is set up as a **CPQ template built around a workflow system**.

- The left workflow rail is organized into **stages**
- Each stage contains **steps**
- Each step has its own **route-backed page**
- Clicking a stage expands or collapses it
- Clicking a step navigates to that step page
- Each step page includes a **proceed action** that advances to the next step, and then into the next stage when needed

The seeded example currently starts with small stages so the template is easy to understand, but the workflow engine is **not** limited to two steps per stage. Teams can add more stages and more steps by extending the workflow data shape.

Today the workflow state is stored locally in browser storage so the template works without backend setup. Teams building on top of this template can keep the same workflow/page structure and replace the local storage source with their own database-backed workflow data. The visible workflow seed is just an example starter, not a product opinion.

The workflow behavior itself now lives in a separate core module, `app/lib/workflow-engine.ts`. The starter CPQ data layer feeds stage/step definitions into that engine, and the current template persists the runtime state in local storage. Teams can keep the same engine and swap only the data source, or move the same engine concepts to the backend if they want the workflow to execute server-side.

## 🎨 Design

- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui-style primitives
- **Color System**: professional neutral base with clear status states
- **Typography**: clean, readable hierarchy for dashboard-style layouts
- **Layout**: shared shell via `app/layouts/MainLayout.tsx`

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 🗄️ Database Architecture

**Technology**: SQLite (`better-sqlite3`) + Drizzle ORM

**Database file path**: `.dbs/database.db`

**Migration workflow**:

1. Update `server/db/schemas.ts`
2. Run `npm run db:generate`
3. Run `npm run db:migrate`

### Tables Implemented

- `estimates`

This intentionally keeps one example table so teams can extend from a clean baseline.

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
npm run check
```

### Coverage Areas

- UI components
- App routes and layout behavior
- Database behavior
- Server service layer

All tests use Vitest (and React Testing Library for UI).

## 🏗️ Example Module

The repository includes one cohesive sample-only module:

- **Estimate**
  - Contract: `server/contracts/estimate.ts`
  - Query: `server/db/queries/estimates.ts`
  - Service: `server/services/estimate.ts`
  - API route: `server/trpc/router.ts`

Use this as the canonical pattern when adding your own modules, or replace it entirely when your application ships its own API contracts and persistence.

This repository is designed as a reference baseline: keep the structure, extend by module, and preserve strict contracts and typed boundaries.
